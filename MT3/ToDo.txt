	-	leave remainder: this extends the time of the output .wav to however long it
		takes all of the sounds to finish playing
	-	loop remainder: this takes the material that would be truncated (cut off)
		under the cut remainder option and automaticaly pastes it over the start of
		the outputed .wav so that it sounds nice when looping
